# Railway-Announcement
Indian Railway announcement system :

For creating this I used PyAudio,Pydub modules and gTTs to process audio and get announcing status of various trains. I used PyAudio module to play and record audio on various platforms. I used Pydub module for audio manipulation. I used gtts tool to interface with GoogleTranslate Text- to-speech API.
